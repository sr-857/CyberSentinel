CyberSentinel is a production-ready threat intelligence and log correlation dashboard. It ingests IOCs from open threat feeds, parses SSH/Apache server logs, correlates log activity against known malicious indicators, and presents analysts with an actionable browser-based dashboard complete with KPI tiles and Chart.js visualisations.

## System Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.11
- Docker ≥ 24 (for containerized deployment)
- OS: Linux, macOS, or Windows (via WSL2 recommended)
- Memory: ≥ 512 MB (2 GB recommended for container workloads)
- Git + Make (optional) for developer tooling

## Architecture Overview

The high-contrast platform flow highlights:

- **Threat Intel (blue)** — AbuseIPDB + AlienVault OTX collectors with deduplication and confidence scoring.
- **Log Ingestion (orange)** — Deterministic SSH/Apache parsing with regex capture groups.
- **Correlation Engine (purple)** — Severity scoring that differentiates SSH brute force vs. web anomalies.
- **Analytics Core (teal)** — Pandas-powered aggregation feeding KPI tiles, charts, and alert summaries.
- **Analyst Dashboard (green)** — Chart.js visualization layer connected to the Flask REST API.

### Backend
- **Flask API** exposes endpoints to fetch threat intel, parse logs, run IOC correlation, produce analytics, and retrieve alerts.
- **Threat Feeds** integrate with AbuseIPDB and AlienVault OTX (extendable to custom sources).
- **Log Parsing** supports SSH auth logs and Apache access logs.
- **Correlation Engine** matches log IPs against known IOCs, generating severity-based alerts.
- **SQLite Database** persists indicators, parsed log events, and alert history.
- **Analytics Module** aggregates IOC matches, SSH activity trends, and web anomalies for charting.

### Frontend
- Responsive dashboard for security analysts with real-time status updates.
- Controls to fetch intel, parse logs, run correlation workflows, and auto-refresh analytics.
- KPI tiles summarising event volumes and active alerts.
- Chart.js visualisations for SSH failures over time, top offending IPs, Apache status mix, and alert severity.
- Tables for Threat Intel, SSH failures, Apache access events, and Alerts.

### Data Layer
- `data/logs` contains realistic sample SSH and Apache logs.
- `data/intel` persists the downloaded IOCs (mounted volume in Docker).

## Design Decisions

- **SQLite for persistence** — Embedded, zero-ops database with ACID semantics ideal for single-node SOC demos and quick resets.
- **Flask REST API** — Lightweight, composable routing with blueprints ready for Gunicorn deployment.
- **Chart.js visualisations** — Straightforward chart primitives that render crisply in GitHub Pages demos.
- **Threat intel normalisation** — Canonical indicator schema with source, first/last seen, and confidence fields for downstream enrichment.
- **Correlation severity model** — SSH matches default to `high`, web anomalies as `medium`, with room to extend to rule-based scoring.
- **Regex-driven log parsing** — Explicit, unit-tested patterns enabling deterministic extraction for security investigations.

## Quickstart

### One-command local install

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script provisions a local virtual environment, installs dependencies, initialises SQLite, and launches the Flask dev server.

### Live Demo / GitHub Pages Preview
- Explore the static walkthrough at **https://sr-857.github.io/CyberSentinel** for an at-a-glance dashboard tour powered by sample data.

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- AbuseIPDB + AlienVault OTX API keys (optional but recommended)

### Environment
Copy the example environment file and edit as required:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Set ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY and OTX_API_KEY if available
```

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Backend available at `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`

### Local Development (Backend)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m backend.db           # initialise SQLite schema (use --purge to reset)
python -m backend.app          # launch Flask server (uses built-in dev server)
```

Then open `frontend/index.html` directly or serve via your preferred static server.

### OpenAPI Specification

- Browse the minimal contract at [`docs/api/openapi.yaml`](docs/api/openapi.yaml) or import into Swagger UI/Postman for contract-first demos.

## Dashboard Preview

- Primary interactions: **Fetch Intel → Parse Logs → Run Correlation → Workflow Refresh**.
- Chart.js canvases highlight SSH failures over time, alert severity mix, and top offending IPs.
- Alerts surface IOC matches with severity scoring, timestamps, and contextual metadata for triage.

## Recruiter Walkthrough

Looking to demo CyberSentinel in under five minutes? Follow this script:

1. **Set the stage (30s)** — “CyberSentinel emulates a Tier-1/Tier-2 SOC workflow: ingest intel, parse logs, correlate IOCs, and deliver analyst-ready visuals.”
2. **Show the data sources (60s)** — Open `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` or `README` to highlight intel feeds (AbuseIPDB, OTX) and sample logs in `data/logs/`.
3. **Run the pipeline (120s)** — In a terminal, execute:
   ```bash
   python -m backend.app  # or docker compose up --build
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:5000` (or `8080` via Docker) and click **Fetch Intel → Parse Logs → Run Correlation**.
4. **Explain the dashboard (90s)** — Walk through KPI tiles, charts (trends, top IPs, status mix, severity), and the tables showing raw intel/logs/alerts.
5. **Close with impact (30s)** — Emphasise automation: reusable intel collectors, deterministic parsing, and a workflow refresh endpoint that chains the entire pipeline.

Talking points:
- Built with Flask + Chart.js, deployable via Docker + Gunicorn.
- Release automation, semantic versioning, and security-conscious defaults (.env handling, .gitignore, API key practices).
- Extensible architecture: add feeds, logs, or correlation rules without rewriting the core.

## Why CyberSentinel Matters
- **Demonstrates security engineering depth** across data ingestion, parsing, correlation, analytics, and UI storytelling.
- **Showcases production-minded operations** with Docker deployment, release automation, and a GitHub Pages preview that mirrors analyst workflows.
- **Highlights portfolio-ready polish**: live badges, architecture diagram, and recruiter guidance make the project immediately legible to hiring managers.
- **Invites collaboration** through clearly scoped contribution issues and sample data for rapid onboarding.

## SOC Scenario Demo

**Scenario: SSH brute force escalation**

1. Threat intel collectors ingest a suspicious IP (`203.0.113.7`) flagged by AbuseIPDB with high confidence.
2. SSH parser detects 40 failed logins against privileged accounts within five minutes.
3. Correlation engine scores a **Critical** alert, persisting evidence and severity rationale.
4. Analytics layer spikes alert severity counts, surfacing the IOC in KPI tiles and Chart.js breakdowns.
5. Analyst uses the dashboard to confirm malicious behaviour and trigger next-step response (ticketing, firewall block, etc.).

## Security Notes
- Use API keys via environment variables—never commit them.
- Logs and intel volumes are mounted read-only/read-write to prevent tampering.
- CORS is enabled for the static frontend; enforce origin restrictions when deploying.
- SQLite is sufficient for MVP; migrate to managed SQL for multi-user deployments.
- Ensure TLS termination in production (e.g., reverse proxy with HTTPS).

## Future Enhancements
1. Add user authentication and RBAC for dashboard access.
2. Enrich alerts with GeoIP/ASN data and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
3. Support additional log sources (e.g., Sysmon, firewall logs, cloud trail).
4. Implement scheduled background jobs/APScheduler for continuous intel ingestion.
5. Integrate with ticketing systems for automated alert escalation and reporting.
